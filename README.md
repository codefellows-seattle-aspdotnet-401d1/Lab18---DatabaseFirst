## ReadMe
- Your readme should include the following information:
	- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
		- Way longer than it should have... probably around an hour of actual work, but easily 4 hours of procrastination and uncertainty.
	- What did you struggle with? Why? How did you solve?
		- I struggled with knowing where to go with the lab, in general. Not being able to follow along during the lecture dropped my information retention to near zero. I used all my research and resources to trudge my way through.
	- What did you learn during this assignment?
		- I learned that I really need to be able to follow along with code, or I won't learn much from the lecture.
    - What resources did you utilize for this assignment?
		- The book, documentation, classmates, TAs, and the Instructor. Really all avenues short of black magic and time travel.
